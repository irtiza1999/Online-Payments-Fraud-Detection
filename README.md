# Online Payments Fraud Detection
Online payment fraud is a growing problem that affects individuals, businesses, and financial institutions worldwide. Fraudulent transactions can result in significant financial losses,
damage to reputation, and can cause disruptions to operations. Therefore, the ability to accurately detect and prevent fraudulent transactions is of utmost importance.
The dataset available on Kaggle provides an excellent opportunity to address this issue, as it
contains a diverse range of transactional data that can be used to build a robust fraud detection
model. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques, we aim to build a model
that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in real-time, providing valuable insights
that can be used to prevent further fraudulent activity.
Our project is not only focused on developing a model that can accurately detect fraudulent
transactions but also on contributing to the larger effort to combat online payment fraud. By
sharing our findings and insights, we hope to raise awareness about the issue and inspire
others to develop similar solutions. Ultimately, our goal is to help create a safer and more
secure online payment ecosystem for all.
